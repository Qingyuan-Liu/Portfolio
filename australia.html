      <h2>Numbat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientific Name: Myrmecobius fasciatus</li>
        <li>Conservation Status: <b>Endangered</b></li>
        <li>The numbat is a small marsupial with an appearance somewhere between a cat and a rat. It has a pointed face, a long, bushy tail, and a series of distinctive white stripes running along its back.</li>
        <li> TNumbats use their pointed muzzles to forage in the dirt for termites, which they scoop up with their long tongues.</li>
        <li>The numbat has a number of natural predators, but it was the introduction of the red fox by settlers that led to the species becoming endangered. </li>
        <li>Today, only around 800 of this once widespread animal are left in the wild.</li>

      <h2>Turtle Frog/Tortoise Frog</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientific Name: Myobatrachus gouldii</li>
        <li>Conservation Status: <b>Least Concern</b></li>
        <li>The turtle frog (also known as a tortoise frog) is a small frog found in the southwestern corner of Western Australia. It lives in semi-arid areas, and has powerful limbs for burrowing in the sandy soil. </li>
        <li>The species gets its name from its turtle-like appearance. It has a round, flat body and resembles a turtle without a shell.</li>
        <li>The turtle frog is unusual among frogs because it skips the tadpole stage of its development, instead hatching from its egg as a small frog.</li>

      <h2>Quoll</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientific Name: Marsupials in the genus Dasyurus</li>
        <li>Conservation Status: <b>Near Threatened</b></li>
        <li>Quolls are small to mid-sized, nocturnal, carnivorous marsupials. There are six species of quoll, four of which–the western, eastern, northern and tiger quoll– are found in Australia.</li>
        <li>Quolls have brown or black coats marked with distinctive pale spots. They prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.</li>
        <li>Like many of Australia’s native animals, quolls suffered greatly with the introduction of non-native predators such as the red fox and domestic cat.</li>
        <li>One of the main threats to quolls comes in the form of another non-native animal: the cane toad. Although not predatory, the cane toad is poisonous. Native Australian animals that prey on the amphibian are likely to become ill or die.</li>

      <h2>Sugar-Glider</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientific Name: Petaurus breviceps</li>
        <li>Conservation Status: <b> Least Concern</b></li>
        <li>The sugar glider is a gliding possum found not only in Australia, but also on New Guinea and some Indonesian islands.</li>
        <li>This small, nocturnal marsupial is equipped with flaps of skin between its arms and legs. These act as wings, allowing the sugar glider to glide from tree to tree.</li>
        <li> The omnivorous sugar glider eats insects, leaves and eucalyptus sap. This opportunist hunter may also eat small reptiles and birds when the chance arises.</li>
