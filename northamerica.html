      <h2>Nine-Banded Armadillo</h2>
      <p>The world's most widespread armadillo, the nine-banded armadillo, ranges across the expanse of North, Central, and South America. Measuring 14 to 22 inches from head to tail and weighing 5 to 15 pounds, the nine-banded armadillo is a solitary, nocturnal—which explains why it so frequently features as roadkill on North American highways—insectivore. When startled, the nine-banded armadillo can execute a 5-foot vertical leap, thanks to the tension and flexibility of the armored scutes along its back.</p>

      <h2>Caribou</h2>
        <p>Essentially a North American species of the reindeer, the caribou consists of four variants, ranging from the small Peary caribou to the much bigger boreal woodland caribou. Human inhabitants of North America have been hunting Caribou for well over 10,000 years; populations are rebounding somewhat today after being on the decline for a decade, even as this even-toed ungulate is restricted to increasingly narrow slices of territory. Climate change and oil and gas drilling could affect their numbers in the future. Woodland caribou are considered a keystone species in their environment.</p>

      <h2>The Black-Footed Ferret</h2>
      <p>All the other North American animals on this list are relatively healthy and thriving, but the black-footed ferret hovers on the brink of extinction. In fact, the species was declared extinct in the wild in 1987, with the last 18 of them becoming breeders for their reintroduction into Arizona, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Today, there are 300–400 black-footed ferrets in the West today, which is good news for conservationists but bad news for this mammal's favorite prey, the prairie dog. The goal is 3,000 in the wild, but disease occasionally wipes out populations. </p>

      <h2>The Gila Monster</h2>
    <p>The only venomous lizard (as opposed to a snake) indigenous to the United States, the gila monster doesn't deserve either its name or its reputation. This "monster" weighs in at only a couple of pounds soaking wet, and it's so sluggish and sleepy that you'd have to be especially crepuscular yourself to get bitten by it. Even if you would get nipped, there's no need to update your will: There hasn't been a confirmed human fatality from a gila monster bite since 1939, which, unfortunately, hasn't prevented many people from reacting disproportionately and deliberately killing any gila monsters they encounter.</p>
